# Task ID: 6
# Title: Error Handling and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling, audit logging, and operational monitoring for on-demand rebalancing system
# Details:
Add robust error handling for database failures, network issues, partial multi-chain failures with proper rollback procedures. Implement comprehensive audit logging using earmark_audit_log table for all state changes, rebalancing operations, and fund movements. Create monitoring for invoice fulfillment rate improvement, rebalancing completion times, multi-chain success rates, and database performance metrics. Include cleanup procedures for failed operations, timeout mechanisms for stuck rebalances, and alerting for system reliability issues.

# Test Strategy:
Error injection testing for database and network failures, audit log completeness validation, monitoring metric accuracy testing, cleanup procedure verification, timeout handling validation, and operational reliability stress testing
